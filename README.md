A turn-based combat/strategy multiplayer game built in Unity, multiplayer was implemented using PUN 2.
The game allows you to pick 4 out of 16 different heroes for your team.
Each hero has one main attack and two abilities with cooldowns.
After you pick your team you face off against an opponent in turns.
Each turn you can either move your hero or use one of his abilities.
